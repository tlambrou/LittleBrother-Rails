## About

Little Brother is a (work in progress) Rails platform for rating and weighting priorities of local, state, and federal governments according to a universal rubric and criteria.

You can check the original mobile app developed in Ionic 2 [here](https://github.com/juliascript/LittleBrother).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2

## Usage

### Version 0.2.x and below

After install the gem, the only thing you should do in your Rails application is add some lines into your manifests files. Add this into your `application.js` file:

```ruby
  //= require bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2
```

and this line into you `application.css` file:

```ruby
  *= require bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2
```

### Version 0.3.x and above

On version 0.3.x or above has been added two dependencies: `jquery-rails` and `font-awesome-rails` in order to keep updated the versions of **jQuery** and **font-awesome**, so be sure to require `jquery-rails` on your `application.js` before require the `bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2` file like so:

```ruby
  //= require jquery
  //= require jquery_ujs
  //= require bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2
```

and on the `application.css` file, be sure to require the `font-awesome-rails` file:

```ruby
  *= require font-awesome
  *= require bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2
```

### RTL Version

If you need the RTL version of the template, add this line into you `application.css` instead of the previous one:

```ruby
  *= require bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2_rtl
```

You can check the RTL version I've used to add this adaptation [here](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/sb-admin2-rtl).

And you're ready to use the HTML structure of the Bootstrap based admin theme SB Admin 2 on your Rails application. All the details and documentation about this are [here](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/).

If you need an example to see how to integrate the gem into your Rails project, I've developed a simple Rails application in order to test the gem, you can check this app here: https://sensor-admin-panel-testing.herokuapp.com (test email: example@email.com, password: 123456example), and here you have the Github repo to be able to check the code: https://github.com/dreamingechoes/sensors_admin_panel.
